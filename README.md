## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewxie04/umd_map.git
cd umd_map
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

## Data

`UMD_api/fetch_availability.py` pulls from UMD's 25live API and outputs `buildings_data.json`. Runs weekly via GitHub Actions.
